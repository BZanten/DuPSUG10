# Keep up with NOW! Automate rebuilding your (home)lab __on steroids__

Thanks for having us @ DuPSUG 10 on 9th March 2017!

Please find our slidedeck and demo material in this GitHub repo.
Our New-LabEnvironment module can be found at the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/NewLabEnvironment/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ralpje/PowerShell-Lab-Module).

I (Sven) will write a blogpost in the near future covering all the demo-steps in detail so you can play along.
**EDIT** Blogpost is published and can be found [here](http://www.svenvanrijen.nl/Home-lab-automation-5/).
